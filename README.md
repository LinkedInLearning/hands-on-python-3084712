If you’re an early-stage Python user looking to boost your professional game, you need to set aside the time—and bandwidth—to study up and advance your skills. Practice makes perfect, they say, so why not start right now? In this course, instructor Ronnie Sheer shows you the tools, techniques, and practical know-how of expert Python users, with twenty hands-on, interactive coding challenges to test out your skills as you go. Take your existing Python proficiency to the next level with tips on scope, strings, loops, CSV data, calculations, JSON data sets, web servers, and more. By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with newly honed expert moves to keep learning on your upcoming projects.<br><br>The best way to learn a language is to use it in practice. That’s why this course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.
